This application is a camp organizer that was created for a client. Due to the concerns of duplication the codebase wouldn't be available. 
This app has the ability to create division and bunks, create schedules for each bunk, take attendance of each student, track expenses, 
create specialize registration forms for campers, and place orders for items that need to be restocked. This application was designed
to accommodate multiple camp creators rather than being limited to a single camp.
