1) Firestarter : A event creator app that uses Google Map API and Geolocator to pin the location of the event that was given by the user. Database that was used for emaiil verificiation and cloud storage was Firebase/ Firestore. 

2) myapp: An application that I am currently developing to cater for my personal day-to-day task. This will incorpate multiple stages: note-taking, daily habits, fitness calendar, and calorite intake tracker. For now the note-taking stage is completed and the others are a work in-progress.

3) Camp App: This application is a way camp organizers and counselors could organize their camps digitally. In this app, we could set up divisions, bunks, campers, daily/monthly schedules, budgets and cost of different supplies. Take attendance of all campers. Report which supplies are running out and notify the camp organizers.
