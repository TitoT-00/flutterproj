1) Firestarter : A event creator app that uses Google Map API and Geolocator to pin the location of the event that was given by the user. Database that was used for emaiil verificiation and cloud storage was Firebase/ Firestore. 

2) myapp: An application that I am currently developing to cater for my personal day-to-day task. This will incorpate multiple stages: note-taking, daily habits, fitness calendar, and calorite intake tracker. For now the note-taking stage is completed and the others are a work in-progress.

3) lab_1: This application was catered to my first lab/ first encounter with flutter. It was suppose to be a random word generator but I changed it to a drink generator that takes a list of non-alcoholic drinks and alcoholic drinks and mixes them to generate unusal drinks that might be tasty.
